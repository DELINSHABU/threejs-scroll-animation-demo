        <h2>üìú Manifesto</h2>
        <h4>  From Pixels to Potential (and Pizza)</h4>
        <p>
          So, you're wondering who this Delin guy is, huh? Well, I'm the 23-year-old coding wizard who somehow managed to survive a Computer Science degree (mostly by trading pizza for debugging help). After that, I dove headfirst into the web dev world, armed with more frameworks than I knew what to do with. I even survived an internship where I learned to juggle OOP, React, and Java without setting anything on fire. Now, I'm a freelance developer, basically a digital problem-solver who occasionally forgets to close his parentheses. But hey, at least the code compiles... most of the time.
        </p>
        <h4>Juggling Projects and Avoiding Coffee Spills</h4>
        <p>
          Currently, I'm juggling three projects, because apparently, I enjoy living on the edge of caffeine-induced chaos. There's a model's portfolio ‚Äì yes, I make websites look pretty too ‚Äì and two commercial projects where I try to make businesses run smoother than a buttered otter. Plus, I had a stint at a BPO, which taught me the valuable skill of pretending to understand corporate jargon. Basically, I'm a multi-tasking maestro, a digital Swiss Army knife, and a professional coffee drinker (I have the stains to prove it).
        </p>
        <h4> AI Dreams and Robot Overlords (Just Kidding... Mostly)</h4>
        <p>"
          When I'm not battling bugs or trying to explain 'responsive design' to my grandma, I'm diving deep into the weird and wonderful world of machine learning and AI. I'm basically trying to teach computers to think, which, let's be honest, is a lot easier than teaching my cat to stop knocking things off the table. My goal? To build awesome stuff that makes people's lives easier (and maybe train a robot to fetch me snacks). So, if you're looking for a developer who's passionate, slightly caffeinated, and always up for a challenge, you've found your guy. Let's build something amazing... and maybe order some pizza."

        <h2>üë©üèΩ‚ÄçüöÄ Projects</h2>

        <p>
         "My project history reads like a techie's fever dream. I've built everything from sleek model portfolios (where I discovered the power of a perfectly placed pixel) to complex commercial applications (where I learned that 'user-friendly' is a relative term, especially when dealing with spreadsheets). Each project was a wild ride, a mix of late-night coding sessions, triumphant bug squashing, and the occasional 'Eureka!' moment that made it all worthwhile. I even managed to deploy a website without accidentally deleting the database once. That's a win in my book."
        </p>

        <h2>üèÜ Accomplishments</h2>

        <p>
          "My journey hasn't just been about building stuff; it's also been about leveling up my skills. I went from intern, making coffee and asking 'what's a terminal?' to freelance developer, confidently wielding React and Next.js like a digital ninja. I've successfully launched multiple projects, each with its own unique set of challenges and triumphs. And, let's not forget, I've mastered the art of explaining technical concepts to non-technical people without causing their eyes to glaze over. That's a superpower, right?"
